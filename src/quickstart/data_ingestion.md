# Data Ingestion

This is a quick overview of how you can ingest data into the Iris network and create an owned data asset class. We won't go into details on specifics in this overview; if you're interested in a deeper look into the specifics take a look [here](../developers/data_assets.md).

## Data ingestion workflow

### Step 0: Setup
Run and configure an IPFS node and an Iris node (e.g. as per [quickstart](./quick_setup.md) or using the light client (*coming soon*)). While this is all technically feasible with the polkadotjs UI, we have built tools to facilitate some of the more manual parts of this process. 

### Step 1: Encryption

In this first phase, we encrypt some plaintext using the `iris_encrypt` RPC endpoint exposed by each Iris node. 

### Step 2: 

### Step 2: Specify gateway node and complete request
