# Storage

The Iris storage system is designed to promote a fully decentralized network by being both availability-encouraging as well as having a low barrier to entry.

## The OBOL

The OBOL is the token that powers the storage system in Iris. OBOL is minted on demand and is an on-chain representation of off-chain storage.

## The storage system

For a full mathematical breakdown of the storage system, please see section 4 of the [iris whitepaper](https://idealabs.network/docs).
