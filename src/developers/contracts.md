# Building smart contracts on iris

Iris leverages the contracts module to allow users to deploy their own contracts to the iris blockchain. We enable developers to build dapps that take advantage of the iris runtime. In particular, Iris exposes a chain extension that provides functionality to call into the iris runtime from contracts deployed to the chain.

## DApps on Iris

### The Iris Asset Exchange

The first app built on Iris is an asset exchange to allow data owners to sell access to data consumers.
