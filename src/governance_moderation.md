# Governance and Moderation

Governance and decentralized moderation are planned for the future and do not currently exist within Iris.

We intend for there to be three layers to this.
Layer 0: Automod capabilities via some ML algorithm.
Layer 1: User initiated reporting and reviewing/reputation score buildup
Layer 2: Democratically elected moderators to provide human input - much the same as moderators exist today.
