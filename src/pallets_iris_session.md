# Iris-Session

The Iris-session pallet incorporates both IPFS and the [session module](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/blob/master/frame/session/README.md) to allow network validators to provide storage for some existing asset class for the duration of a session. In general, it provides the capabilities to:

- provide storage to the network
- capitalize on latent storage capacity
- eject data from the network
