# Iris-Assets

The iris-assets module relies on the [assets module](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/blob/master/frame/assets/README.md) available in Substrate. This pallet provides capabilities for content owners and content consumers. This module is entirely independent of IPFS. It provides capabilities to:

- inject data into the network
- create and manage storage asset classes
- mint and burn assets
