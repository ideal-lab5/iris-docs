# Technical Overview

## Nodes 
- Storage Provider: The storage provider node's responsibility includes processing commands added to the queue by other nodes and submitting the results of the command on chain. 
- Content Owner: A content owner is responsible for making data available in some external IPFS node and interacting with Iris to ingest and maintain access to it.
- Content Consumer: A content consumer is responsible for using owned tickets to access owned content.


## Runtime Storage

* DataQueue
* Stores a vector of DataCommand enums, which are processed by iris nodes to interact with IPFS.
```
StorageValue<
      _,
      Vec<DataCommand<<T::Lookup as StaticLookup>::Source, T::AssetId, T::Balance, T::AccountId>>,
      ValueQuery
  >
```


 * AssetClassOwnership
 * Maps owner to cid to asset id
  ```
    StorageDoubleMap<
        _,
        Blake2_128Concat,
        T::AccountId,
        Blake2_128Concat,
        Vec<u8>,
        T::AssetId,
        ValueQuery,
    >
  ```    
* AssetAccess
* Maps an accountId to a Cid they have access to, to the account id of the owner of the underlying asset class
  ```
   StorageDoubleMap<
        _,
        Blake2_128Concat,
        T::AccountId,
        Blake2_128Concat,
        Vec<u8>,
        T::AccountId,
        ValueQuery,
    >```

## Extrinsics

### Iris Pallet
--- 
- `create_storage_asset`
- description: submits an on-chain request to fetch data and add it to iris 
- weight: `0`
- parameters:
  * `admin`: The address of the node who the asset administration is assigned
  * `addr`: the multiaddress where the data exists
       example: `/ip4/192.168.1.170/tcp/4001/p2p/12D3KooWMvyvKxYcy9mjbFbXcogFSCvENzQ62ogRxHKZaksFCkAp`
  * `cid`: the cid to fetch from the multiaddress
       example: `QmPZv7P8nQUSh2CpqTvUeYemFyjvMjgWEs8H1Tm8b3zAm9`
  * `id`: the unique id of the asset class -> should be generated instead
  * `balance`: the balance to back the asset class which will be created
---
* `request_data`
* description: Queue a request to retrieve data behind some owned CID from the IPFS network
* weight: `0`
* parameters
  * `owner`: The owner node
  * `cid`: the cid to which you are requesting access
---
* `submit_ipfs_results`
  * Description: submits IPFS results on chain and creates new ticket config in runtime storage
  * Parameters:
    * `admin`: The admin account
    * `cid`: The cid generated by the OCW
    * `id`: The AssetId (passed through from the create_storage_asset call)
    * `balance`: The balance (passed through from the create_storage_asset call)
---
* `mint_tickets`
* Description: Only callable by the owner of the asset class. Mint a static number of assets (tickets) for some asset class (cid).
 * weight: `0`
 * Parameters:
   * origin: should be the owner of the asset class
   * beneficiary: the address to which the newly minted assets are assigned
   * cid: a cid owned by the origin, for which an asset class exists
   * amount: the number of tickets to mint
---
* `purchase_ticket`
  * Description: Not yet implemented
