The [Iris-Assets](./pallet_iris_assets.md) pallet provides functionality for nodes to inject data into Iris, create and manage storage asset classes and to mint and burn assets.

The [Iris-Session](./pallet_iris_session.md) pallet provides session-based storage capabilities for network validators as well as enables ejecting data from the network.
